INSTALLER ERROR:
The database "cimigeno_web" has "24" tables.  The Duplicator only works with an EMPTY database.  Enable the action "Connect and Remove All Data" radio button to remove all tables and or create a new database. Some hosting providers do not allow table removal from scripts.  In this case you will need to login to your hosting providers control panel and remove the tables manually.  Please contact your hosting provider for further details.  Always backup all your data before proceeding!
